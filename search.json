    "text": "I am a middle-aged, nonbinary person. My pronouns are they / them. I live in Edwardsville, IL with a spouse (Ed), a teenager (Isabella), and two adopted cats (Bo and Cap’n). I was born and lived in Italy until I was 20. My previous career was in science, specifically in research and development, where I was a director of R&D in the field of biotechnology. I have several advanced degrees, including a PhD in Chemistry and a Master of Divinity from Eden Seminary in St. Louis, where I graduated in 2022. I received Preliminary Fellowship from the UUA Ministerial Fellowship Committee in April 2023 and was ordained in April 2024 by the congregation in Montclair, New Jersey where I also did my internship. In my spare time I like to walk, read, do yoga and meditation, and take naps."

    "text": "I am passionate about social justice, and about working towards ending oppressions. I think that every person who works for justice even in the smallest way makes a difference. Maybe they don’t see it, but it’s there. I am passionate about family, including chosen family and community. I think that humans are gregarious creatures and spiritual life is best grown in community. I am passionate about authenticity. I wish that more people would allow themselves to be vulnerable, to not fear failing or revealing too much of themselves. I am also passionate about rest and joy and beauty. These are necessary to survive.\n\n\n\nThere is a Love holding and connecting all.\n\n\n\nBecause this is a faith that saved my life, that taught me the joy of community and the fire of commitment.\n\n\n\nYes, upon request.\n\n\n\nThrough my email, strupia@uuma.org"
